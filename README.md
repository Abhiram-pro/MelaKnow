# MelaKnow
Hi, I am Abhiram Ganji, the creator of MelaKnow, and I currently studying in grade 11. If you are wondering what MelaKnow is let me tell you about it, MelaKnow is an app that helps diagnose melanoma a lethal disease that can certainly be cured with early detection unfortunately there was no accessible solutions to this problem Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society has estimated about 99,780 new melanoma patients will be diagnosed (about 57,180 in men and 42,600 in women). It's also expected that almost 7,650 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection potentially aided by data science can make treatment more effective.     I was inspired to make this app way back in Singapore when one of my friends had been diagnosed with a vicious form of cancer that was detected late. Even after huge fundraising he was unfortunately not able to make it, ever since I had wanted to use my skill and make a solution to this problem, this was a pivotal moment that had deeply touched me, and here during this internship at Clevered, I found a wonderful opportunity to bring my ideas to life.
